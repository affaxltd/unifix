# UniFix

UniFix patches Uniswap's exchange site to remove the blocklisted tokens. I'll keep it updated for some time.

## Why?

I wanted to create this extension as I feel like everyone should be able to use the trusted [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) exchange page, without needing to get around the blacklisted tokens with untrustable forks. The source for this extension is open and easy to read, and you can see that no "funny business" is happening.

## Installation

### Step 1

Download the complete zip from [this link](https://codeload.github.com/affaxltd/unifix/zip/refs/heads/master)

### Step 2

Extract the zip into your preferred folder, be it on your desktop or your secondary drive, the location doesn't matter in this case.

### Step 3

Go to your extension page on [Brave](brave://extensions/) or [Chrome](chrome://extensions/) and toggle the "Developer mode" on the top right of your window. If it's already on just move to the last step.

### Step 4

Click on the "Load unpacked" button on the top left of your window, and select the foler you extracted the zip into. Note, this folder needs to be the folder with the `manifest.json` file.
